## Project contents

  - This project implements continuous integration and continuous deployment of a Docker container. It includes both projects used to achieve these goals.

	- Project 4 Continuous Integration allowed us to perform auto updates to a docker image through github actions based on triggers set using a github workflow. This way as long as someone has the secret and token set up they can push updates to github and the workflow will handle the rest.
	  - [Project 4 README-CI.md](Project4/README-CI.md)
	- Project 5 Continuous Deployment allowed us to implement Continous deployment of a docker container using webhooks via dockerhub and github
	  - [Project 5 README-CD.md](Project5/README-CD.md)
